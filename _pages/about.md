Hello, welcome to my website! ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Xinhui Sun (å­™æ¬£æ…§)**. I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Illinois at  Urbana-Champaign. 

I am an applied microeconomist with research interests in environmental, behavioral, and labor economics. I use big data and causal inference methods to study how economic agents, such as individuals and firms, respond to environmental challenges, including air pollution and natural disasters, and to environmental regulations.

I will be on the 2025-2026 academic job market.
