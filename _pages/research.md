[**Air Pollution and Economic Activity: Evidence from Foot Traffic Patterns in the U.S.**]({% link /files/Pollution_Avoidance.pdf %})<br>
I investigate how air pollution affects economic activity. Using over 600 million phone- location-based foot traffic data points from SafeGraph, I conduct a large-scale analysis to examine the causal effect of air pollution on activity patterns across the US. Using changes in local wind direction as an instrumental variable (IV) for air pollution, I find that a 1 $\mu g/m^3$ increase in PM2.5 concentration leads to a 0.50% decrease in economic activity, resulting in a nationwide reduction of 43 million trips annually. The reductions are widespread across different economic sectors, with recreational activities experiencing the largest decline. The effect is more pronounced in higher-income counties and areas with a larger share of chil- dren, suggesting greater awareness among wealthier or more vulnerable populations.

[**Go with the Wind: Polluters’ Strategic Response to Wind Directions**]({% link /files/Disguised_Pollution.pdf %})<br>
I investigate the strategic behavior of polluters in the US. Under the Clean Air Act, air quality monitor data determine whether an area meets environmental standards. Because wind carries pollution, monitors detect more pollution from upwind sources and less from downwind sources. This disparity incentivizes polluters to emit less when they are upwind of a monitor, and more when they are downwind. I identify such strategic behavior among US coal-fired power plants, finding that a one-standard-deviation increase in favorable wind direction—when wind blows pollutants away from monitors—leads to a 0.8% (172 lbs) and 0.4% (54 lbs) increase in sulfur dioxide ($SO_2$) and nitrogen dioxide ($NO_x$) emissions, respectively. At the same time, fuel input remains unchanged, but the emission rate rises, suggesting that power plants temporarily turn off pollution control equipment. Additionally, the increase is more pronounced when power plants are in a non-attainment county, located in the same state as the monitor, or surrounded by fewer nearby polluters. These findings suggest that polluters facing stricter regulatory pressure are more likely to respond strategically when conditions are favorable.
